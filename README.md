This project focuses on early screening of Parkinson’s Disease using voice signals.
Parkinson’s disease often affects speech characteristics such as pitch stability, loudness, and vocal tremor. By analyzing these voice patterns using signal processing and machine learning, this system predicts whether a given voice sample is Healthy or shows Parkinson’s risk.

The application is built as a full-stack system with a machine learning backend and an interactive web frontend.

	•	The dataset contains voice recordings, which may be sensitive in nature
	•	Dataset usage is restricted to academic purposes
	•	Trained models are derived from this data and are therefore not publicly shared

Reproducibility:
	•	Complete feature extraction and training scripts are provided
	•	Anyone with legitimate access to the dataset can reproduce the results by running:
       python extract_features.py
       python train_model.py
